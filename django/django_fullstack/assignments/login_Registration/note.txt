This project is done - by the ajax checking email validations

- only for email.
- + applying special characters like + and so on to be safe while sending through the http transmission 

explain:/ :)

Why encodeURIComponent() is important:

Without encoding:
// If user types: "test@example.com"
body: 'email=test@example.com'  // ✅ Works fine


With special characters:
// If user types: "user+tag@example.com" 
body: 'email=user+tag@example.com'  // ❌ PROBLEM! + becomes space

With encoding:
// If user types: "user+tag@example.com"
body: 'email=user%2Btag%40example.com'  // ✅ Safe! + becomes %2B, @ becomes %40

that's become the issue with validations about emails

so, characters that get encoded:
+ → %2B
@ → %40
& → %26
= → %3D
% → %25
Spaces → %20

Why this matters:
Security: Prevents injection attacks
Reliability: Ensures special characters in emails are preserved
Standards: Follows HTTP protocol requirements
User Experience: Users can use any valid email format
